## Compressive-Strength
# Predicts the compressive strength of concrete with partial replacement of sand by iron waste.
# Concrete Strength Predictor GUI
# Overview
This GUI project is designed to predict the compressive strength of concrete with sand partially replaced by iron waste. The underlying predictive model is based on machine learning techniques and is optimized for accuracy.

# Features
Predictive Model: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict concrete compressive strength.
User-Friendly Interface: The GUI is designed for easy interaction and input from users.
Input Validation: Ensures that user inputs are within acceptable ranges for realistic predictions.
Accuracy: The underlying model has been fine-tuned for optimal predictive performance.


# Input Parameters:

Enter values for Iron Waste (%), Water, Coarse Aggregate, Fine Aggregate, Fine Aggregate (%), and Age of Concrete.
Click "Predict":

After entering values, click the "Predict" button to get the predicted concrete compressive strength.
Results:

The predicted compressive strength will be displayed on the GUI.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter Library
# Acknowledgments
This project is based on a research study on concrete strength prediction, and the GUI provides a practical interface for utilizing the predictive model.
